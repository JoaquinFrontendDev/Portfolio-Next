Either way if you delete your task o tasks by mistake, the re-do button with do the trick. Of course has lots of weak points but it's a step up from "Meeting Point"`,

    description: `Pretty straight foward SPA, made in a day maybe two, super simple, it does what it needs to do. No challenges on this one, used OpenWeatherMap, easy to use, very handy API.

Maybe in the future some tweaks will be done, but the main idea wasn't anything fancy but pragmatic`,
